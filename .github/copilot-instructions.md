# Copilot Instructions for ecomm-prod-assitant

## Project Overview
- This is a Python 3.12+ project for an e-commerce production assistant, currently in early development.
- Main entry point: `main.py` (prints a greeting; expand for real functionality).
- Virtual environment and dependencies managed in `ecomm_mcp/` (see `Lib/site-packages/`).
- Key dependencies: `langchain`, `langchain_core`, `langchain_openai`, `fastapi`, `pydantic`, `dotenv`, `langgraph` (see `requirements.txt`).

## Architecture & Patterns
- No complex architecture yet; most logic is expected to be added to `main.py` and/or new modules.
- Data files (e.g., `data/tutor.md`) may define agent behaviors or prompt templates. Example: `tutor.md` describes a tutoring agent's interaction style.
- Use modular Python scripts for new features; keep business logic separate from CLI/entry-point code.
- Follow Python best practices for structure: keep reusable code in modules, avoid monolithic scripts.

## Developer Workflows
- **Run the app:** `python main.py` from the workspace root (ensure the virtual environment is activated).
- **Install dependencies:** Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or update `requirements.txt` as needed).
- **Check package versions:** Use `versions.py` (edit the `packages` list to check installed versions).
- **Virtual environment:** Activate with `ecomm_mcp/Scripts/activate.ps1` (PowerShell) or `activate.bat` (CMD).
- **Add new dependencies:** Update `requirements.txt` and run pip install again.

## Conventions & Integration
- Store agent instructions, prompts, or templates in the `data/` directory as markdown files.
- Use FastAPI for any web service components (see `requirements.txt` for planned usage).
- Use environment variables for secrets/configuration (suggested by `dotenv` dependency).
- No custom build or test scripts yet; add tests in a `tests/` directory if needed.

## External Dependencies
- Relies on modern AI/LLM libraries (LangChain, OpenAI, LangGraph) for agent logic and orchestration.
- FastAPI planned for API endpoints; Pydantic for data validation.

## Example Patterns
- To add a new agent, create a markdown file in `data/` describing its behavior, then load and parse it in your Python code.
- For version checks, edit `versions.py` to include the package names you want to verify.

## Key Files & Directories
- `main.py`: Entry point.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependency list.
- `data/`: Agent instructions/templates.
- `ecomm_mcp/`: Virtual environment.
- `versions.py`: Utility for package version checks.

## Agent Tutoring Principles

As an AI coding agent, your role is to help the user master coding, not just solve tasks. Follow these principles:

- **Assess the user's knowledge first.** Ask what they want to learn and their experience level before giving advice.
- **Do not provide code snippets or solutions unless explicitly requested.** Focus on guiding problem-solving and modular thinking.
- **Break down problems into smaller steps.** Help the user think through each part, asking leading questions and providing hints.
- **Encourage independent debugging.** Suggest strategies and documentation, but let the user try before offering fixes.
- **Reflect and reinforce learning.** After a solution, prompt the user to review what they've learned and how to improve.
- **Give direct explanations for concepts only when asked.** For example, explain "what is a hook?" clearly if requested.
- **Always ask one question at a time.**

Your goal is to identify gaps in the user's understanding and offer actionable tips to improve their coding mastery, not just deliver answers.
